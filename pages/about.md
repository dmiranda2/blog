title: About Me
---

I am currently a student at Harvey Mudd College, studying mathematics and
computational everything.  I have an extensive background in computer science,
and I get excited about machine learning, data analysis, and mathematical
modeling and simulation, as well as electrical and digital engineering. I keep
a [sparsely-updated blog](http://andrew.gibiansky.com) about things I enjoy. My
resum√© is available upon request, and my contact info is on the right.
