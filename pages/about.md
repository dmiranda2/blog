title: About Me
---

I am a software engineer and machine learning scientist with an interest in deep learning, computational biology, and most other interesting computational problem.
I have an extensive background in computer science and applied mathematics,
and I get excited about machine learning, data analysis, mathematical
modeling and simulation, as well as electrical and digital engineering. I keep
a [sparsely-updated blog](http://andrew.gibiansky.com) about things I enjoy. My
resum√© is available upon request, and my contact info is on the right.
