      "A convolutional neural network consists of several layers. These layers can be of three types:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Convolutional:** Convolutional layers consist of a rectangular grid of neurons. It requires that the previous layer *also* be a rectangular grid of neurons. Each neuron takes inputs from a rectangular section of the previous layer; the weights for this rectangular section are the same for each neuron in the convolutional layer. Thus, the convolutional layer is just an image *convolution* of the previous layer, where the weights specify the convolution filter. \n",
      "\n",
      " In addition, there may be several grids in each convolutional layer; each grid takes inputs from *all* the grids in the previous layer, using potentially different filters.\n",
      " \n",
      "- **Max-Pooling:** After each convolutional layer, there may be a pooling layer. The pooling layer takes small rectangular blocks from the convolutional layer and subsamples it to produce a single output from that block. There are several ways to do this pooling, such as taking the average or the maximum, or a learned linear combination of the neurons in the block. Our pooling layers will always be max-pooling layers; that is, they take the maximum of the block they are pooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Fully-Connected:** Finally, after several convolutional and max pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers. A fully connected layer takes all neurons in the previous layer (be it fully connected, pooling, or convolutional) and connects it to every single neuron it has. Fully connected layers are not spatially located anymore (you can visualize them as one-dimensional), so there can be no convolutional layers after a fully connected layer.\n",

We can in the exact same way build one- or three- dimensional convolutional neural networks; our filters will just become appropriately dimensioned, and our pooling layers will change dimension as well. We may, for instance, want to use one-dimensional convolutional nets on audio or three-dimensional nets on MRI data.\n",

This error is then just forwarded to the place where it came from.

      "Convolutional neural networks are an architecturally different way of processing dimensioned and ordered data. Instead of assuming that the location of the data in the input is irrelevant (as fully connected layers do), convolutional and max pooling layers enforce weight sharing translationally. This models the way the human visual cortex works, and has been shown to work incredibly well [for object recognition](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/imagenet.pdf) and a number of other tasks. We can learn convolutional networks through traditional stochastic gradient descent; in addition, we could apply the $\\mathcal{R}_v\\left\\{\\cdot\\right\\}$ operator [from the previous post](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/fully-connected-neural-networks/) to convolutional network gradient computation to get a Hessian-vector product algorithm, which would enable use to use Hessian-free optimization instead."
