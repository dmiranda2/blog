      "Hessian-free optimization, which we've discussed [before](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/hessian-free-optimization/), uses the [quadratic conjugate gradient algorithm](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/conjugate-gradient) at every iteration of the Newton-style method (which is why it is also known as the Newton-CG method). However, when discussing Hessian-free optimization, we glossed over a few crucial details, and in this post, I'll seek to correct one of these and justify our correction. Note that I rely heavily on the material presented by [Schraudolph in 2002](http://home.arcor.de/linoleo/pubs/mvp.pdf) and [James Martens in 2010](http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/icml2010_Martens10.pdf), so you may peruse the original research for the information presented here."

      "\n",
      "In order to bound $f(x)$ from below, we require that the matrix $A$ not have any negative eigenvalues. If $A$ had negative eigenvalues, then we could set $x$ to be the corresponding eigenvector. Then, when computing $x^T A x$, multiplication by $A$ would then pick up a negative coefficient, and the $x^T$ would give us some negative value (the eigenvalue times the norm of $x$). Since we could scale $x$ to have any norm we want, we could choose a norm make $f(x)$ arbitrarily small (by making it very negative). Thus, to prevent this, we enforce the previously mentioned condition that $A$ be positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues of $A$ are greater than or equal to zero).\n",

As it turns out, that assumption is definitely *wrong*, as the Hessian *can* be non-positive semi-definite. We had no reason to make that assumption in the first place, either! (In fact, the definiteness of the Hessian can be used to determine whether a critical point is a saddle point, minimum, or maximum.)\n",

      "In this post, we looked at assumptions we made in our derivation of Hessian-free optimization. Using conjugate gradient meant we had to have a positive semidefinite matrix. Since conjugate gradient goes towards the extremum of the function, having a matrix that wasn't positive semi-definite would mean that the algorithm could fail to decrease the objective, and could even take steps uphill *away* from the minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "This assumption turned out to be problematic, because the Hessian was not guaranteed to be positive semidefinite. We then derived an approximation to the Hessian known as the Gauss-Newton matrix. The Gauss-Newton matrix is a good approximation for two reasons; first of all, quadratic optimization objectives using the Gauss-Newton matrix instead of the Hessian have the same minimum, and second, it is provably positive semidefinite. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we derived the neural network matrix-vector product for the Gauss-Newton matrix. It turns out that we can compute $Gv$ for any vector $v$ by running $\\Rv{\\cdot}$ forward propagation to get the vector $a = Jv$; then, run one step of $\\Rv{\\cdot}$ backward propagation in order to multiply it by $H_\\sigma$; finally, run normal neural network backpropagation to finish computing $Gv$. \n",
      "\n",
      "These improvements to our Hessian-free optimization algorithm should make it more robust in the presence of difficult optimization objectives. In his 2010 paper, Martens observes that using this modification was consistently superior to using the Hessian alone, or other, more complex fixes to the problem that the Hessian is not positive semi-definite. In addition, this turns out to be significantly faster than computing the full Hessian-vector product!"
