Thus, we start with some set activations at the input layer, compute inputs to the neurons at the next layer, use the nonlinearity to get their activations, and continue propagating values until we reach the output layer.

      "We started with a basic description of fully connected feed-forward neural networks, and used it to derive the forward propagation algorithm and the backward propagation algorithm for computing gradients. We then used the method developed by Pearlmutter to develop an adjoint algorithm pair that, in a forward and a backward pass, computes the Hessian-vector product $Hv$ for any vector $v$ in the weight space. This allows us to create second order optimization algorithms that use the Hessian *without* ever computing the Hessian itself, permitting more performant neural network training algorithms."
